18(a) You could create a class called transportation. Then you could make it so that methods of transportations (i.e. buses, trains, e.t.c.)
      are classes that extend transportation. Each individual transportation method could have different properties and methods.

19(a) public void convert(allCodes[] c){
            for(int i=0;i<c.length;i+=){
                for(int j=0;j<c.length;j+=){
                    if(c[i].equals(c[j]){
                    //put it into an array list, but I don't know how to
                    }
                }
            }
